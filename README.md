# Data Science Portfolio - William Rusli
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my Competetncies, micro projects, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.

## Projects

Climate change has a negative impact on agricultural production. Unpredictable weather can potentially affect crop yields and the resources that need to be allocated. The purpose of this project is to help PT. GGP to generate climate information as a basis for decision-making so that plant resource management can be more efficient and the risk of crop failure can be minimized. In this project I have used models such as GRU and 1D-CNN to predict the weather ahead of its time based on 4 years of weather data.

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting American Sign Language Handsign and classifying them into corresponding letters. The purpose of this project is to help people learn and understand handsign easily, serving as a baseline model for future improvements. In this project I used pre-trained models such as VGG16 to help model reach the desired accuracy faster using 1,820 pictures of ASL.

SkinCer-in is an app made to help people diagnose skin cancer with the ease of using your phone camera. SkinCer-in also provides information about various types of skin cancer, its symptoms, and the information needed to help treat the cancer. In this project, the data used for training is scraped from multiple sources on the internet, comprising over 1800 pictures of skin cancer. We used Google's latest pre-trained model, EfficientNet-B5, to help classify and detect skin cancers.
